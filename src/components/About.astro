      Frontend developer with six years of experience delivering web and mobile
      applications using React and React Native. Prior to transitioning into
      software development, I spent five years as a quality engineer in
      automotive manufacturing, bringing a strong foundation in problem-solving
      and process optimization. I hold a BS in Mechanical Engineering from
      Georgia Tech and completed certifications in full-stack development
      through Udacity and Kenzie Academy. Currently, I serve as a Senior
      Consultant at Aviron Software, where I partner with clients to build and
      maintain production applications.
